## What is really is JS? 
    - High abstrated. 
    - JIT (Just-In-Time)
    - Multi-paradigm Programming Language
    - Proto Typed Based 
    - JavaScript is dynamically typed
    
    Summmary: Garbage Collection, JIT compiled, High Abstraction, Multi-Paradigm, Dyanamically-typed, Prototyped based. 


## JavaScript Engine V8 Internal mechanism: 
     - Parser 
     - Abstract Syntax Tree
     - Interpreter Ignition 
     - Compiler Turbfan 
     - Bytecode 
    

## JavaScript Execution Context and Call Stack: 
    - Environment 
    - a place of js code gets executed. 
    - Stored in the execution context. 

    - Global Execution Context (GEC)
        - Creation phase
        - Execution Phase
    - Function Execution Context (FEC)
    
    - Call Stack 


## Single-Threaded, Asynchronous vs Synchronous 

    = SetTimeout
    = Single Threaded 
        - Single threaded means only one statement is excuted at a time. 
        - JS only has one call stack. 
    = Synchronous
        - Serail wise
    = Asynchronous
        - random
