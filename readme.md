## What is really is JS? 
    - High abstrated. 
    - JIT (Just-In-Time)
    - Multi-paradigm Programming Language
    - Proto Typed Based 
    - JavaScript is dynamically typed
    
    Summmary: Garbage Collection, JIT compiled, High Abstraction, Multi-Paradigm, Dyanamically-typed, Prototyped based. 


## JavaScript Engine V8 Internal mechanism: 
     - Parser 
     - Abstract Syntax Tree
     - Interpreter Ignition 
     - Compiler Turbfan 
     - Bytecode 
    

## JavaScript Execution Context and Call Stack: 
    - Environment 
    - a place of js code gets executed. 
    - Stored in the execution context. 

    - Global Execution Context (GEC)
        - Creation phase
        - Execution Phase
    - Function Execution Context (FEC)
    
    - Call Stack 


## Single-Threaded, Asynchronous vs Synchronous 

    = SetTimeout
    = Single Threaded 
        - Single threaded means only one statement is excuted at a time. 
        - JS only has one call stack. 
    = Synchronous
        - Serail wise
    = Asynchronous
        - random 
    

## Promise, Aync/Await 
    - Promise - Asynchronous Operation 
        - Resolve 
        - Reject Use Catch 


## SetInterval and ClearInterval with X++ and ++x 
    - SetTimeout
    - SetInterval
    - make digital clock 

## JavaScript event loop and concurrency 
    - Call stack 
    - Event Queue
    - Event Loop JS

## Error Handing: Try, catch, throw and finally 
    - Try
    - Catch 
    - Throw 
    - Finally 


## What is debugging? 
    - How does the debugging process work? 
    - Some Debugging techniques:
        - Using console.log() method
        - Setting the breakpoints
        - Backtracking.

    - Syntax Error 
    - Type Error 
    - Reference Error 
    - Internal Eror 
    - Range Error

## Understand Reference errors and type error message




# Interview Question 
    - What is Promise?
    - How does it works? 
    - Tell me something about js engine v8 internal mechanism.
    - What is event loop in JavaScript?
    - If javascript is single threaded, how does it handle asynchronous call?
    - Differences between setTimeOut and SetInterval 
    - Can you explain the difference between an async function and a regular function in JavaScript?
    - What's the error handling strategy for promises hat were rejected while awaiting? 
    - What are the state of a promise?
    - Can you explain what the then() method does?
